Unlike generic speech recognition systems, this ASR understands regional agricultural terminology, local crop names, dialects, and rural accents, enabling farmers to interact with digital platforms effortlessly through voice.\n3.a. project : Rythuvaani - Rythuvaani is building a Telugu agriculture domain-specific dataset for building the Speech-to-Text (STT) system that understands conversational speech in all regional dialects.\nWe are collecting 30,000 hours of conversational agricultural audio from all 59 districts, ensuring a minimum of 500 hours per district to accurately capture every local dialect and speech variation. This extensive dataset will be transformed into verified audio–text pairs for fine-tuning advanced open-source STT models. By building such a rich, domain-specific corpus, we aim to enable highly accurate, responsive, and farmer-friendly conversational AI that understands real-world agricultural communication across regions.\nThis dataset and STT model will directly empower 10 million farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Farmers will be able to interact with conversational voice agents for crop advisory, input access, market information, and government schemes.Governments and agri-tech companies will have access to a scalable, indigenous AI infrastructure built specifically for agriculture \n\n4.

Unlike generic speech recognition systems, this ASR understands regional agricultural terminology, local crop names, dialects, and rural accents, enabling farmers to interact with digital platforms effortlessly through voice.\n3.a. project : Rythuvaani - Rythuvaani is building a Telugu agriculture domain-specific dataset for building the Speech-to-Text (STT) system that understands conversational speech in all regional dialects.\nWe are collecting 30,000 hours of conversational agricultural audio from all 59 districts, ensuring a minimum of 500 hours per district to accurately capture every local dialect and speech variation. This extensive dataset will be transformed into verified audio–text pairs for fine-tuning advanced open-source STT models. By building such a rich, domain-specific corpus, we aim to enable highly accurate, responsive, and farmer-friendly conversational AI that understands real-world agricultural communication across regions.\nThis dataset and STT model will directly empower 10 million farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Farmers will be able to interact with conversational voice agents for crop advisory, input access, market information, and government schemes.Governments and agri-tech companies will have access to a scalable, indigenous AI infrastructure built specifically for agriculture \n\n4.

This extensive dataset will be transformed into verified audio–text pairs for fine-tuning advanced open-source STT models. By building such a rich, domain-specific corpus, we aim to enable highly accurate, responsive, and farmer-friendly conversational AI that understands real-world agricultural communication across regions.\nThis dataset and STT model will directly empower 10 million farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Farmers will be able to interact with conversational voice agents for crop advisory, input access, market information, and government schemes.Governments and agri-tech companies will have access to a scalable, indigenous AI infrastructure built specifically for agriculture \n\n4.

Unlike generic speech recognition systems, this ASR understands regional agricultural terminology, local crop names, dialects, and rural accents, enabling farmers to interact with digital platforms effortlessly through voice.\n3.a. project : Rythuvaani - Rythuvaani is building a Telugu agriculture domain-specific dataset for building the Speech-to-Text (STT) system that understands conversational speech in all regional dialects.\nWe are collecting 30,000 hours of conversational agricultural audio from all 59 districts, ensuring a minimum of 500 hours per district to accurately capture every local dialect and speech variation. This extensive dataset will be transformed into verified audio–text pairs for fine-tuning advanced open-source STT models. By building such a rich, domain-specific corpus, we aim to enable highly accurate, responsive, and farmer-friendly conversational AI that understands real-world agricultural communication across regions.\nThis dataset and STT model will directly empower 10 million farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Farmers will be able to interact with conversational voice agents for crop advisory, input access, market information, and government schemes.Governments and agri-tech companies will have access to a scalable, indigenous AI infrastructure built specifically for agriculture \n\n4.

This extensive dataset will be transformed into verified audio–text pairs for fine-tuning advanced open-source STT models. By building such a rich, domain-specific corpus, we aim to enable highly accurate, responsive, and farmer-friendly conversational AI that understands real-world agricultural communication across regions.\nThis dataset and STT model will directly empower 10 million farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Farmers will be able to interact with conversational voice agents for crop advisory, input access, market information, and government schemes.Governments and agri-tech companies will have access to a scalable, indigenous AI infrastructure built specifically for agriculture \n\n4.

This extensive dataset will be transformed into verified audio–text pairs for fine-tuning advanced open-source STT models. By building such a rich, domain-specific corpus, we aim to enable highly accurate, responsive, and farmer-friendly conversational AI that understands real-world agricultural communication across regions.\nThis dataset and STT model will directly empower 10 million farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Farmers will be able to interact with conversational voice agents for crop advisory, input access, market information, and government schemes.Governments and agri-tech companies will have access to a scalable, indigenous AI infrastructure built specifically for agriculture \n\n4.

This extensive dataset will be transformed into verified audio–text pairs for fine-tuning advanced open-source STT models. By building such a rich, domain-specific corpus, we aim to enable highly accurate, responsive, and farmer-friendly conversational AI that understands real-world agricultural communication across regions.\nThis dataset and STT model will directly empower 10 million farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Farmers will be able to interact with conversational voice agents for crop advisory, input access, market information, and government schemes.Governments and agri-tech companies will have access to a scalable, indigenous AI infrastructure built specifically for agriculture \n\n4.

This extensive dataset will be transformed into verified audio–text pairs for fine-tuning advanced open-source STT models. By building such a rich, domain-specific corpus, we aim to enable highly accurate, responsive, and farmer-friendly conversational AI that understands real-world agricultural communication across regions.\nThis dataset and STT model will directly empower 10 million farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Farmers will be able to interact with conversational voice agents for crop advisory, input access, market information, and government schemes.Governments and agri-tech companies will have access to a scalable, indigenous AI infrastructure built specifically for agriculture \n\n4.
